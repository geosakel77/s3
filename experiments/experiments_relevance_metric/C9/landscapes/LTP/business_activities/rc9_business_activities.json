This can disrupt operations and lead to data breaches.\n\n4. **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks**: These attacks can overwhelm transport systems or websites, making them unavailable to users. This can disrupt ticketing systems, logistics management, and other critical operations.\n\n5. **Data Breaches**: Sensitive information related to passengers, freight, and operational data can be targeted for theft. This can lead to identity theft, financial fraud, and loss of customer trust.\n\n6. **Insider Threats**: Employees or contractors with access to critical systems may intentionally or unintentionally compromise security, leading to data leaks or system disruptions.\n\n7. **IoT Vulnerabilities**: The increasing use of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in transport (e.g., smart sensors, GPS tracking) can introduce vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit to gain access to networks or disrupt operations.\n\n8. **Malware Attacks**: Malware can be used to infiltrate transport systems, allowing attackers to manipulate operations, steal data, or disrupt services.\n\n9. **Physical Security Threats**: Cyber threats can also extend to physical security systems, such as surveillance cameras and access control systems, which can be hacked to facilitate physical breaches.\n\n10. **Social Engineering**: Attackers may use social engineering tactics to manipulate employees into granting access to secure systems or divulging sensitive information.\n\n11. **Cyber Espionage**: State-sponsored actors may target transport infrastructure to gather intelligence or disrupt operations for geopolitical reasons.\n\n12. **Legacy System Vulnerabilities**: Many transport systems rely on outdated technology that may not be adequately secured, making them susceptible to exploitation.\n\nTo mitigate these threats, organizations in the transport sector should implement robust cybersecurity measures, including employee training, regular security assessments, incident response plans, and the adoption of advanced security technologies."
