This can include mishandling data or maliciously stealing information.\n\n8. **Credential Theft**: Cybercriminals may target healthcare professionals to steal login credentials, allowing them to access patient records and other sensitive information.\n\n9. **Social Engineering**: Attackers may use social engineering tactics to manipulate healthcare staff into divulging confidential information or granting access to secure systems.\n\n10. **Compliance Violations**: Failure to protect patient data can lead to violations of regulations such as HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) in the U.S., resulting in legal penalties and loss of trust.\n\n11. **Telehealth Vulnerabilities**: With the rise of telehealth services, there are new vulnerabilities related to video conferencing tools and online patient management systems, which can be exploited if not properly secured.\n\n12. **Malware Attacks**: Malware can be introduced into healthcare systems through various means, including infected devices or software. This can lead to data theft, system damage, or operational disruptions.\n\nTo mitigate these threats, healthcare organizations should implement robust cybersecurity measures, including employee training, regular security assessments, data encryption, and incident response plans."
